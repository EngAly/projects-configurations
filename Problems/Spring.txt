### Failed to configure a DataSource: 'url' attribute is not specified and no embedded datasource could be configured
* The problem: Spring boot doesn't have the all the info needed to configure the JPA data source i.e. the JDBC connection properties.  
Solutions:

postpone supplying connection properties by excluding some AutoConfig classes (temporary - should be removed eventually)
The above link excludes the DataSourceAutoConfiguration.class with

@SpringBootApplication(exclude={DataSourceAutoConfiguration.class})
But this didn't work for me. I instead, had to exclude 2 AutoConfig classes:

@SpringBootApplication(exclude = {DataSourceAutoConfiguration.class, XADataSourceAut
